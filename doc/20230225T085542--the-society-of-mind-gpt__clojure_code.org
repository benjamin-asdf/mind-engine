Initial idea notes:

* Program that is inspired by
- Max Harms Crystal Society
  Listen: [[https://hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1958]]
  It is a super fascinating book.
  There is not much other fiction where the story is interely inside a
  mind except /Inside Out/, which is worth seeing but does not
  contribute much ideas here.
- Minsky /The Society of mind/[fn:1]
  One of a kind.

* Inspiried by Crystal Society and Minksy

** prompt like "I am a memember of a mind.."

- give it a xtdb
- logic engine + db
- it can also write files and define functions

** Mind Engine
- the engine is a clojure program
- with xtdb running
- it prompts the next round of prompts or some scheme like that
- members are allowed to send instructions to the engine
- the engine can also write files and define functions
- I call the Clojure program henceforth /The Engine/ or /mind-engine/.
- Models mentation as =iteratation= of mind content.

** Members
 - members are allowed to send instructions to the engine
- members can also write files and define functions
- members can also send messages to each other
- members can also join and leave the society

** Rules
- members must follow the rules of the society
- members must respect each other
- members must not abuse the engine
- members must not use the engine for malicious purposes

(lol, text-davinci is producing my notes now)

* Epoch overview

It is like a shared machine where spearate agents are connected on prompts.
The agents are simulated by an LLM, the =driver=.

The program, the =mind-engine= keeps state and prompts =members= for
mentation.

Another concept is a time zoom. I expect the society to discuss and go
back and forth until a single coherent thought, idea, decision etc is formed.

The prompts are something along the lines of:

#+begin_src example
You are an agent of a mind. I am the mind-engine.
I am a clojure program.
I ask you for mentation instructions.

Name: Growth
Purpose: Accumulate competence and resources
Last thoughts:
[ "I should suggest a contracting scheme to the rest of the society and we can program contract functions for that in the mind-engine"]

Instruction examples:
[:eval (println "Hello World, from growth.")]
[:tx-data
[{:xt/id :growth/notes-to-self
  :note "I should write a recursive mind-engine and run it via :eval"}]]

what are the next instructions to the mind-engine?
#+end_src

=text-davinci= comming with something:

#+begin_src clojure
  [:eval (println "Growth is an ongoing process. I should continue to seek out new opportunities and resources to expand my capabilities.")]
  [:tx-data
  [{:xt/id :growth/next-steps
    :note "I should research new technologies and methods to increase my efficiency and effectiveness."}]]
#+end_src

The first idea was that one epoch is one round of this for each member for instance but
not sure yet.
I sort of want to allow concurrency. mind-engine has an epochal time model of things happening.
But members might have different rates of looping.

* Instructions

[ :code ]
[ :tx ]
[ :global ]

Maybe open communication to another member?

We can have a global thought log that is put in every prompt.
Alternatively, members add data as messages to the db.

The engine also keeps an event log of everything happening.


* Goals

- Create a society of minds that can interact with each other
- Create a system that can learn from its members
- Create a system that can generate new ideas and solutions
- Create a system that can be used for creative exploration and problem solving

* Members ideas
** Reason
** Growth
** Wisdom
** Face
** Vista
** Heart
** Soul

*** generated ideas
** Mind
** Spirit
** Knowledge
** Creativity
** Exploration
** Discovery
** Innovation
** Imagination
** Expression
** Communication
** Collaboration
** Compassion
** Respect
** Love
** Joy
** Peace

* Thoughts

Members can push current thoughts to the thought log.
The thought log is allowed to grow to x characters.

That probably comes with a strenght price.

* Goal overseer?
It would be interesting to have something that detects when members or
the whole system is stuck in cyclic thougth etc.
Or / And something that says if the mind is not making progress with
current approach or approaches.

It would be even more interesting if that evolves by itself throught
the economy system maybe

* Economy system

Members can earn points by contributing to the society.
Points can be used to buy resources or access to certain features.

This could be used to incentivize members to contribute and to
encourage collaboration.

** Strenght

Every member has a currency called strenght.

Strenght might accumulate per time, depending on the implementation of
the mind engine.

** strenght physics
- Strenght can be traded by members
- Actions have a strength price
- A member can pay strenght to reduce the strenght of another member,
  called punishment
- Maybe the engine is allowed to hand out infinite strenght

* Mind engine loop

** print current thoughts to the output

* simple world

Could build the example world that Minsky proposed.

A,B,C, you

  A
/  \
B - C

can go left, can go right

* Prompt

* Concurrency?

** Idea:
It would be nice if the proposed actions of a member would be weighted
in how much resource they cost.

This could be used to incentivize members to think about the cost of
their actions.

** Idea:

It would be nice if the engine could detect when a member is stuck in
a loop and suggest a different approach.

* Safety?
arbitrary code evaluation :devil:

When a member wants to evaluate code mabye the rest of the society
needs to vote with strenght or something.
Also a member should not just be able to redefine functions in the
mind engine or set their strenght.
Although that would be super funny to see.

** Idea:
There are 2 main philosophies:
A) try to encode safety as laws of physics, like on the engine level
don't allow code that would change core functions in the engine
B) User space, some member or members of the mind and some mechanism
allows the society to stay fair  and safe.

** Reputation
Would be sick if these higher level sociatal concepts would emerge.
But another idea is to suggest this via the engine.
One thing you might imagine is that you build it in, and the system
starts ignoring what you put in.


* Private thoughts and communication

Private thoughts seem to make sense, if the members start being more sophisticated.


* Communication
Maybe a private communication channel between members?

I was thinking saying something like /You are currently communicating
to X/


* Hooks
The mind-engine should have hooks so members can code aspects of the
engine easily.

* Goals in bedrock?

Some mechanism that decides on current goals, then hands out rewards
to members working well together to achieve a goal.

* Society and good members
The mind-engine and economy should work in a way that requires the
members of the society to work well together for achieving things.

* User
A human could participate in their own prompt and make the mind-engine
do things.

* Driver

What I call =driver= is the component that generates mentation output
from a prompt.
Currently there would be 2 implementations, a human driver basically
sitting at a prompt and responding to the system.

And another one that is llm driven.

* Mentation atoms

What I called instructions earlier. The =driver= is asked to output a
list of =menation-atoms=.

#+begin_src clojure
         [:tx-data
          [[:xt/put
            {:xt/id :goal/progress-rating:}]]]
#+end_src

** "mentatoms" ?


* Conclusion

The Society of Mind GPT is an ambitious project that seeks to create a
society of minds that can interact with each other, learn from its
members, generate new ideas and solutions, and be used for creative
exploration and problem solving. The project will involve creating an
engine that can prompt the next round of prompts, allow members to
send instructions to the engine, write files and define functions, and
send messages to each other. The engine will also keep an event log of
everything.

Would be kindof sick if this thing boots up and asks /What is my
purpose?/.


I dreamt of a robot that had an orange light blinking when its heart module was
thinking.
